### Objectives

PPC-pM2 circuit mapping, i.e., **V1-PPC-pM2-V1** *ipsilateral*

[visual cortex gives **biggest** input chunk (>20%) to both PPC-STR & PPC-pM2

➡️  PPC-pM2 neurons receive more sensorimotor inputs, PPC-STR neurons receives more association inputs.] Hwang 2019

➡️  sensorimotor cortical circuit mapping, / sensorimotor predictive coding mapping:

- ACC is bidirectionally connected with pM2

- ACC gives predictive signals to V1

- also primary visual input (from eyes) goes to V1, V1 does "basic (?)" computation,

- sends "processed" motor-info-coupled visual info to PPC

- M2 sends a predictive flow to V1

- thus completes the update loop

[the input from ACC to V1 has a role in attentional modulation of visual responses (Zhang et al., 2014) and experience-dependent spatial predictions (Fiser et al., 2016).] Leinweber 2017

- why this is important

- hypothesis



### Research Plan

discussed with Matt:

- do V1-PPC-pM2

- question: what info, i.e., physiologically speaking, does V1-PPC & pM2-V1, i.e., how does V1 involve/contribute to visuomotor behaviour

- techniques:

    - npx*3, with V1 & PPC back-to-back together
    
    - terminal inhibitory opto, in pM2-V1 terminal, & V1-PPC terminal
    
- behaviour:

    - my new behaviour :)


- timescales (Gantt chart)

    - **coincidence detector**: express ChR2 to PPC-M2 projections -> stimulate these axons in M2 during behaviour & npx recording -> electrical signal will back-propages to somas in PPC:
    
        - light on: AP from PPC-M2 projecting neurons will be cancelled by ChR2 stimulation -> correspond npx channels will loss AP signal
        
        - light off: AP from PPC-M2 projecting neurons will successfully reach M2 -> npx picks up AP signal;
        
        - compare light on & off conditions -> accurately identify channels in npx that pick up AP signals from PPC-M2 projecting neurons
        
    - the same behaviour? a year of new behaviour development
    
    - expand the current circuit, & use different techniques to acquire info from all levels (e.g., inhibitory opto, meso scope imaging, more npx probes)
    
    - decoding success rate?
        
        - layer/ area specific decoding
    
    - for research plan:
    
        - behaviour & analysis sandwiched to allow adaptation
    
        - less well for a short time rather than everything perfect for a long time
    
    - handedness change may be caused by the uncomfortable behavioural setting (under head fixed condition), need to check lateralised studies in rodents
    
    - introduce double-step hand movement to mice??
    
    - **CAUTION! do NOT plan too much! EVERYTHING takes a lot of time!! V1-PPC-M2/ACC needs two postdoc (2-year)**

- contingency plan
