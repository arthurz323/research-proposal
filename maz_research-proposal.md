reaching behaviour -> 

Primates heavily rely on forelimbs to interact with the external environment. Forelimb reaching behaviour necessitates complex visuomotor cortical computations of visual stimulus perception and interpretation, target location, action preparation, selection, and execution [Galiñanes 2018, Archambault 2015]. Upon visual presence of the target, motor planning information from the higher-level cortical areas has to converge with the lower-level viusal information to initiate a successful reach. Such process and its underlying neural mechanisms have been extensively studied in human and non-human primate models [Georgopoulos 1982, Georgopoulos 1986, Schwartz 1988, Archambault 2015], and immense evidence has pointed out that the posterior pariatal cortex (PPC), a key hub that conducts sensorimotor transformation, is necessary for the successful performance of viusally-guided reaching [Mountcastle 1975, Johnson 1993, Caminiti 1996, Anderson 1997, Desmurget 1999, Pisella 2000, Battaglia-Mayer 2001, Archambault 2009, Reichenbach 2011, Archambault 2015].

However, the PPC alone does not paint the whole picture; to depict the neural (sub)circuits controlling the viusally-guided reaching behaviour and further dissect the role of each node and their interactions, recent visuomotor experiments are shifting towards using mouse models [Luo 2008, O' Connor, 2009, Pho 2016, Makino 2017, Whishaw 2017, Galiñanes 2018, Hwang 2019]. Apart from the availability of the latest viral, genetic, electrophysiological, and projection-specific inhibitory tools that allow neuronal-resolution experimental manipulations and circuit mapping, comprehensive knowledge about the mouse brain and its reduced complexity will also aid teasing out basic visuomotor neural mechanisms [Galiñanes 2018]. Moreover, homologous with which in primates, forelimb reaching behaviour is too highly prevalent in rodents [Whishaw 1992, Sacrey 2009, Whishaw 2017, Galiñanes 2018,]. Therefore, adapting primates' viusally-guided reaching behavioural paradigm to rodents is essential for ethological and translational visuomotor neural circuits mapping.

Indeed, experimental work on mouse models has been fruitful; the role of PPC and the visuomotor (sub)circuits it belongs to are revealing. The PPC not only has recurrent anatomical connections with visual cortices, especially the primary visual cortex (V1), and the secondary motor cortex (M2) [Zingg 2014, Goard 2016, Zhang 2016, Hovde 2018, Hwang 2019], these projections are found to be functionally necessary for visuomotor transformation [Pho 2016, Goard 2016, Leinweber 2017, Hwang 2019]. Specifically, visual information encoded by the V1 goes to the PPC [Goard 2016], the PPC-M2 neurons use which to selectively control movement planning, selection, and its kinematic features (i.e., "geometry of motion") [Hovde 2018, Hwang 2019], and the M2 combining with its adjacent anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in turn provide movement-related visual predictive flow back to the V1 [Leinweber 2017]. Together, these areas complete the visuomotor processing loop that controls the viusally-guided reaching behaviour.

Despite (giving/providing) prominent progress,

to tracing experiments in mice have shown that visual cortices (VC) are the biggest input source to the PPC, with a substantial amount comes from V1 [Zingg 2014, Hovde 2018, Hwang 2019]; the PPC in turn projects to the motor areas, one subpopulation of PPC neurons selectively projects to the secondary motor cortex (M2) [Hovde 2018, Hwang 2019]. 

Interestingly, Leinweber et al. 2017 found a considerable amount of neurons from the M2 and its adjacent anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) give input back to V1 with predictive information flow. ... supporting its contribution/in line with the primates studies... to visuomotor transformation... not just anatomical, these projections are involved in visuomotor processing functionally.

**continute here: consider: put anatomical & functional results together or separated???**

 including V1, and a distinct PPC neuron subpopulation projects to the secondary motor cortex (M2)...**PPC-M2 encodes kinematic features ("geometry of motion") of movement, movement planning & online adjustment, action selection**. interestingly, considerable amount of ACC/M2 together gives input back to V1 with predictive information flow [Leinweber 2017]; while ACC-VIS has been clearly identified [Zhang 2014, Zhang 2016], M2-V1 has not been extensively studied..., and [Zhang 2016] traced visual areas as a whole, not V1;  ➡️  thus, more specific tracing & circuit mapping is needed

**focus on Galiñanes & Hwang & Leinweber here**



 

Focusing on the primary visual cortex (V1) and PPC, Pho et al. (2016) found that PPC neurons ... *yet a go/no-go visual discrimination task does not necessarily require/ is not visuomotor-processing-demanding as reaching.../ does not directly recruit visuomotor processing/coupling, even though go/no-go signal is visual, its interpretation goes directly into higher-level which then sends "decision" to motor area & initiate movement/push. & licking as motor output has limited translational value*


V1 encodes visual stimulus [Goard 2016]



(visually-guided behaviour gives insight to cortical visuomotor processing, why using this behavioural paradigm is good: **directional reaching paradigm has not only allowed the development of important concepts about population coding (Georgopoulos et al., 1986), motor planning, mental rehearsal, decision making (Cisek and Kalaska, 2004, 2005), and neuroprosthetic control (Taylor et al., 2002), but also offered the basis for computational frameworks, necessary to causally link neuronal activity with motor control (Scott and Kalaska, 1997; Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi, 1994). Cue-guided, delayed, and memory-based versions of this task have made it possible to probe different aspects of sensory-motor processing. [Galiñanes 2018]**)

***behaviour is not the most important thing here! what's happening in the brain is!! --> need to focus on how this behaviour give indication of visuomotor cerebral processing!!!***

Visual information has  While the primary visual cortex (V1)   





However, little is known about how sensorimotor information integrates to perform the visually-guided reaching behaviour.

Evidence immensely point out that the posterior pariatal cortex (PPC) is necessary for the successful performance of viusally-guided reaching. In humans, bilateral PPC lesion does not cause pure motor or visual deficit, and yet, patients are incapable of accurately guiding their hands to viusal targets (Pisella 2000, Archambault 2015). 

~~PPC ... a key hub that conducts sensorimotor transformation which is critical for viusally-guided behaviour. it associates visual and motor cortical (Pho 2016, Hwang 2019, Anderson 1997)~~

& M2


Specifically, feedforward and feedback signals are continuously flowing across 







Given **"the close resemblance of the reach-to-grasp sequence supports the hypothesis that reaching behavior is homologous in rodents and primates (Sacrey et al., 2009; Whishaw et al., 1992)" Galinanes et al., 2018"...** To map out the underlying sensorimotor neural (sub)circuit and further dissect the role of each node and their interaction, it is essential to develop sensorimotor behavioural paradigm in mouse models so that the latest genetic and electrophysiological tools can be implemented.

...... recent mice studies also validate that PPC is a key hub that associate visual and motor cortical areas (sensorimotor transformation; Pho 2016, Hwang 2019, Anderson 1997)


after behaviour development, cortical circuit:

As forelimb reaching behaviour in rodents highly resemble primates,

recently has it been adapted into mouse models to exploit genetic and electrophysiology tools <sup>1,</sup>.




- visuomotor behaviour
    
    - forellimb reaching is frequent yet needs complex cortical computation
    
    - extensively studied in primate models, carefully tease out each node of the neural circuit --> use mouse models
    
        - advantages compare to primate: available tools -> higher neuronal resolution & more precise manipulation; simpler anatomical construction -> find basic mechanism might be generalised; less time-consuming -> quicker experimental rotation;

    - PPC: viusally-guided reaching & visuomotor coupling
    
    - pM2: esp. introduce PPC-pM2 functioning from Hwang et al., 2019

    - pM2 projects back to V1

- behaviour paradigm

    - water restriction
    
    - viusally-guided reaching behaviour
    
    - head-fixed (allow multi-probe recording & opto; avoid freely moving period cuz some mice never learnt to use the forellimb, when they cannot reach the spout with tongue they give up; all mice in HF box use forellimb to get water from the very beginning; tho limitation is that FM mice learn faster, get more reward, performance more stable, more "natural" behaviour, less stress)
    
    - stick with current behaviour, but add one more spout  ➡️  left, mid, right
    
        - instead of moving all the way to 7mm, distance stays in a comfortable region (depends on the body size of each mouse), difficulty of the task is demonstrated by the pattern of lighting-up:
        
        1. single spout: build light-water association till >75%
        
            - left only
        
            - mid only
        
            - right only
        
        2. spout lights up: left  ➡️  mid  ➡️  right
        
            - pattern became predictable
        
            - ITI gradually  ⬇️ to max. no. of trial & success rate for expert mice
        
        3. introduce mis-match: right  ➡️  mid  ➡️  left
        
        4. move-on to recording when >75%
        
    - use infrared beam to detect movement trajectory & allow cortical inactivation at a specific behavioural point

    - terminal inhibitory opto (Komiyama 2019)





Movement is guided by vision.

Vision, as a dominant sensation, extensively contributes to behaviour (check motivation letter & neural dynamics proposal). One key hub of the visuomotor information coupling is posterior pariatal cortex (PPC), evidence has been found in both primates and mice (ref. here). **Specifically, PPC lesion in human causes optic ataxia (OA), i.e., inability to guide the hand to viusal targets, without pure motor/visual deficit**; in mice, bilateral PPC-pM2 neurons inactivation disrupts the preparation of movements to produce fast & consistent movements...

evidence has shown that PPC receives projections from V1 (V1 feeds info to higher-level cortex e.g., PPC; find refs!), pM2 projects to V1 with motor-coupled visual flow predictions, yet in this visuomotor cortical circuit, the physiological information sent & received by V1 in unknown, let alone how these information change over sensorimotor behaviour learning.

current project working on circuit mapping PPC-pM2:

- naive mice, visuomotor

- expert mice, 

thus, this project aims to expand the current two-node mono-directional visuomotor cortical projection into a three-node visual-processing-centred visuomotor cortical circuit, 


Proposed Research (main part; max. 1400 words)
----------------------------------------------

aim 1: novel behavioural paradigm development

aim 2: in naive mice, map physiological information V1-PPC, & M2-V1

aim 3: dissect physiological & temporally role of each node by axonal terminal inhibitory opto

### Objectives

- why this is important

- **hypotheses???**: V1 plays a vital role (is essential) in sensorimotor cortical circuit during visually-guided behaviour

1. V1 performs low-level visual processing and provides PPC with basic motor-related visual information for further visuomotor integration
    
    - exp: V1-PPC axonal terminal inactivation
    
2. M2 provides predictive motor-related visual flow to V1 that is essential for visuomotor learning

3. V1-PPC-M2-V1 subnetwork becomes increasingly coordinated across learning of a visuomotor task

    - i should hypothesise about the property/characteristics of the physiological info, e.g., pM2 sends predictive flow (corollary discharge) to V1, and V1 performs on-site computation (filtration? coupling?), and send motor related flow to PPC (ask Matt...)
    

PPC-pM2 circuit mapping, i.e., **V1-PPC-pM2-V1** *ipsilateral*

[visual cortex gives **biggest** input chunk (>20%) to both PPC-STR & PPC-pM2

➡️  PPC-pM2 neurons receive more sensorimotor inputs, PPC-STR neurons receives more association inputs.] Hwang 2019

➡️  sensorimotor cortical circuit mapping, / sensorimotor predictive coding mapping:

- ACC is bidirectionally connected with pM2

- ACC gives predictive signals to V1

- also primary visual input (from eyes) goes to V1, V1 does "basic (?)" computation,

- sends "processed" motor-info-coupled visual info to PPC

- M2 sends a predictive flow to V1

- thus completes the update loop

[the input from ACC to V1 has a role in attentional modulation of visual responses (Zhang et al., 2014) and experience-dependent spatial predictions (Fiser et al., 2016).] Leinweber 2017




### Research Plan

discussed with Matt:

- do V1-PPC-pM2

- question: what info, i.e., physiologically speaking, does V1-PPC & pM2-V1, i.e., how does V1 involve/contribute to visuomotor behaviour, & how does this "loop" update over learning

- techniques:

    - npx*3, with V1 & PPC back-to-back together
    
    - terminal inhibitory opto, in pM2-V1 terminal, & V1-PPC terminal
    
- behaviour:

    - my new behaviour :)
    
- note: Leinweber 2017 uses Ca imaging, i.e., not physiological, thus my stuff will be novel :)


- timescales (Gantt chart)

    - **coincidence detector**: express ChR2 to PPC-M2 projections -> stimulate these axons in M2 during behaviour & npx recording -> electrical signal will back-propagates to somas in PPC:
    
        - light on: AP from PPC-M2 projecting neurons will be cancelled by ChR2 stimulation -> correspond npx channels will loss AP signal
        
        - light off: AP from PPC-M2 projecting neurons will successfully reach M2 -> npx picks up AP signal;
        
        - compare light on & off conditions -> accurately identify channels in npx that pick up AP signals from PPC-M2 projecting neurons
        
    - the same behaviour? a year of new behaviour development
    
    - expand the current circuit, & use different techniques to acquire info from all levels (e.g., inhibitory opto, meso scope imaging, more npx probes)
    
    - decoding success rate?
        
        - layer/ area specific decoding
    
    - for research plan:
    
        - behaviour & analysis sandwiched to allow adaptation
    
        - less well for a short time rather than everything perfect for a long time
    
    - handedness change may be caused by the uncomfortable behavioural setting (under head fixed condition), need to check lateralised studies in rodents
    
    - introduce double-step hand movement to mice??
    
    - **CAUTION! do NOT plan too much! EVERYTHING takes a lot of time!! V1-PPC-M2/ACC needs two postdoc (2-year)**

- contingency plan
