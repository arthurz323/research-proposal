### Objectives

PPC-pM2 circuit mapping, i.e., **V1-PPC-pM2-V1**

- why this is important

- hypothesis



### Research Plan

- timescales (Gantt chart)

    - **coincidence detector**: express ChR2 to PPC-M2 projections -> stimulate these axons in M2 during behaviour & npx recording -> electrical signal will back-propages to somas in PPC:
        - light on: AP from PPC-M2 projecting neurons will be cancelled by ChR2 stimulation -> correspond npx channels will loss AP signal
        - light off: AP from PPC-M2 projecting neurons will successfully reach M2 -> npx picks up AP signal;
        - compare light on & off conditions -> accurately identify channels in npx that pick up AP signals from PPC-M2 projecting neurons
        
    - the same behaviour? a year of new behaviour development
    
    - expand the current circuit, & use different techniques to acquire info from all levels (e.g., inhibitory opto, meso scope imaging, more npx probes)
    
    - decoding?
        
        - layer/ area specific decoding
    
    - for research plan:
    
        - behaviour & analysis sandwiched to allow adaptation
    
        - less well for a short time rather than everything perfect for a long time
    
    - handedness change may be caused by the uncomfortable behavioural setting (under head fixed condition), need to check lateralised studies in rodents
    
    - **CAUTION! do NOT plan too much! EVERYTHING takes a lot of time!! V1-PPC-M2/ACC needs two postdoc (2-year)**

- contingency plan
