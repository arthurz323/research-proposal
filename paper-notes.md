# Hwang et al., 2019 "corticostriatal flow of action selection bias"



## Question

- PPC (posterior parietal cortex) contributes to decision making & movement control, but which input & output pathways support these functions?
---


## Parallel Circuits

**PPC-STR (dorsal striatum)**

- receives stronger input from association areas (**??**)
    
- encodes *history-denpendent choice bias*:
    - inhibit PPC-STR neuron decreases history-denpendent choice bias

- **select action**

**PPC-pM2 (posterior secondary motor cortex)**

- receives stronger sensorimotor input:
    - inhibit PPC-pM2 neuron alters movement kinematics

- **control movement**
---


## Techniques & Results

**PPC-STR & PPC-pM2 Represent Largely Distinct Subpopulations**

- inhibit PPC-STR soma during ITI (inter-trial interval), but not choice period, *weakens* history-denpendent bias of the following trial
    
    ➡️ PPC encodes history-dependent bias during **ITI**, and used by downstream STR during choice
    
➡️ identify flow of bias by tracing:

- unilateral anterograde AAV-CAG-tdTomato in PPC, ➡️ PPC projects to: footnote: [lalalalalala]
    - pM2
    - STR
    - S1 (primary somatosensory cortex)
    - associative thalamus
    - auditory cortex
    - visual cortex
    - superior colliculus
    

[^1]: projections are largely **ipsilateral** to the injection site.

**PPC Neurons Projecting to STR and pM2 Receive Distinct Long-Range Inputs**


**History-Dependent Bias Is Preferentially Encoded by PPC-STR Neurons**


**PPC-STR Pathway Is Required for History Bias**
