# Hwang et al., 2019 "corticostriatal flow of action selection bias"



## Question

- PPC (posterior parietal cortex) contributes to decision making & movement control, but which input & output pathways support these functions?



## Parallel Circuits

### PPC-STR (dorsal striatum)

- receives stronger input from association areas (**??**)
    
- encodes *history-denpendent choice bias*:
    - inhibit PPC-STR neuron decreases history-denpendent choice bias

- **select action**

### PPC-pM2 (posterior secondary motor cortex)

- receives stronger sensorimotor input:
    - inhibit PPC-pM2 neuron alters movement kinematics

- **control movement**



## Techniques & Results

### PPC-STR & PPC-pM2 Represent Largely Distinct Subpopulations

- inhibit PPC-STR soma during ITI (inter-trial interval), but not choice period, *weakens* history-denpendent bias of the following trial
    
    ➡️ PPC encodes history-dependent bias during **ITI**, and used by downstream STR during choice
    
➡️ need to identify flow of bias

**Projection tracing:**

- unilateral anterograde AAV-CAG-tdTomato in PPC, ➡️ PPC projects <sup>1</sup> to:
    - **pM2**
    - **STR**
    - S1 (primary somatosensory cortex)
    - associative thalamus
    - auditory cortex
    - visual cortex
    - superior colliculus

> <sup>1</sup> projections are largely *ipsilateral* to the injection site.

- unilateral RVDG-GFP (retrograde glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus encoding GFP) in STR to PPC & RVDG-tdTomato in pM2 to PPC in the same animal <sup>2</sup>

- unilateral retrograde CTB (cholera toxin subunit b)-red in STR to PPC & retrograde CTB-green in pM2 to PPC in the same animal <sup>2</sup>

> <sup>2</sup> The contralateral PPC contained only 2% ± 1% of all retrogradely labeled PPC neurons from STR injections & 4% ± 1% from pM2 injections, thus only *ipsilateral* is analysed.


**Identify spatial distribution of PPC-STR & PPC-pM2 neurons:**

- PPC-STR is more than PPC-pM2

- PPC-STR & PPC-pM2 are largely overlapped *spatially*, yet *PPC-pM2 is more superficial, lateral, and posterior*

- <10% PPC neurons are double-labelled ➡️ PPC-STR & PPC-pM2 represent largely distinct PPC neuron subpoplations


### PPC Neurons Projecting to STR and pM2 Receive Distinct Long-Range Inputs




### History-Dependent Bias Is Preferentially Encoded by PPC-STR Neurons



### PPC-STR Pathway Is Required for History Bias





- two-photon calcium imaging during decision-making

- inhibitory opto

    - PPC-STR neuron soma or terminal
    
    - PPC-pM2 soma
