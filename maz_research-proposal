### Research Plan

- timescales (Gantt chart)

    - **coincidence detector**: express ChR2 to PPC-M2 projections -> stimulate these axons in M2 during behaviour & npx recording -> electrical signal will back-propages to somas in PPC:
        - light on: AP from PPC-M2 projecting neurons will be cancelled by ChR2 stimulation -> correspond npx channels will loss AP signal
        - light off: AP from PPC-M2 projecting neurons will successfully reach M2 -> npx picks up AP signal;
        - compare light on & off conditions -> accurately identify channels in npx that pick up AP signals from PPC-M2 projecting neurons
        
    - the same behaviour, expand the current circuit, & use different techniques to acquire info from all levels (e.g., inhibitory opto, meso scope imaging, more npx probes)
